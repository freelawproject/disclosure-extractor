Disclosure Extractor
====================

Disclsoure Extractor is an open source repository to extract data from PDFs
of judicial financial data
It was built for use with Courtlistener.com.

It uses image processing and OCRing to extract data on financial records.
Additional functionality estimates a judges' net worth from the disclosures.

Further development is intended and all contributors, corrections and additions are welcome.

Background
==========

Free Law Project built this to help extract out data from roughly 18k financial
records. These records are available for a limited period from the US Government
before they are destroyed.  In an effort to review roughly 20 years of records we needed
a method to extract out the information at a high degree of accuracy.

Quickstart
===========

Below is an example output from Justice Alitos' abbreviated output
from his 2011 disclosure, followed by the output in table format with
calculations.

The main function process_financial_document accepts a url, filepath,
or PDF as bytes.

::

    from disclosure_extractor import (
        process_financial_document,
        print_results
    )
    output = process_financial_document(filepath)


::

        returns:

Fields
======

The main sections are as follows.

1. :code:`Positions` ==> dict;
2. :code:`Agreements` ==> dict;
3. :code:`Non-Investment Income` ==> dict;
4. :code:`Non Investment Income Spouse` ==> dict;
5. :code:`Reimbursements` ==> dict;
6. :code:`Gifts` ==> dict;
7. :code:`Liabilities` ==> dict;

Known Limitations
=================

This code was developed for financial disclosures released after
2007ish.  In older documents reimbursements was consolidated into
only two fields from the current five.  This causes data to be
incorrectly identified by sections.

Installation
============

Installing disclosure-extractor will be easy.


        pip install disclosure-extractor


Or install the latest dev version from github

Future
=======

1) Continue to improve output for older financial disclosures

Deployment
==========

Releasing a new version to PyPI is handled in a Github workflow.

Once a version is ready to be released, adjust the version number in the
setup.py file and add tag the branch in the following format and push to github.

::

    v*.*.*

The action will build and push to PyPI.



If you wish to create a new version manually, the process is:

1. Update version info in ``setup.py``

2. Install the requirements in requirements_dev.txt

3. Set up a config file at ~/.pypirc

4. Generate a universal distribution that worksin py2 and py3 (see setup.cfg)

    ::

        python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

5. Upload the distributions

    ::

        twine upload dist/* -r pypi (or pypitest)

        python setup.py sdist upload -r pypi
